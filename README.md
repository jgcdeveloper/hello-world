# Understanding Markdowns

Hello Alex. I am looking forward to chatting with you in the coming days and weeks of the *Bloc* program.

As part of my first *Bloc.io* assignment, I am to write you a message using some simple markdowns. This message is in response to that assignment.

## My Goal with Joining *Bloc.io*
To be frank, I hope to use *Bloc.io* as a jumping point to a career as a software developer, or even software engineer (although I am not sure if I can legally use that title in Canada)

## My Inspirations in Life
My current inspirations in life include:

* To provide for my family
  * My daughter **Arina**
  * My wife **Olya**
* A gain a better understanding of how things work. I was one of those "How's It Made" nerds.
* To see as many places in the world (beautiful or not) as I can

## Random Questions Running Through that Damned Brain of Mine
1. Am I putting myself at a disadvantage by starting out with a Windows machine. How soon should I plan a switch to Linux or MacOS.
2. I got Git Bash running... Will I ever make sense of the thing??
3. That Atom text editor is pretty cool, I wonder if I will actually make use of it...
4. Which programming langauges do I want to learn, especially as a supplement to what I will learn in *Bloc.io*
